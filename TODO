Things to do for submission
Do the measure theory proofs for equivalent, subadditive, existence of
completion, hausdorff measure properties in dimension only
Then do the example analysis for cantor set
Some trimming and pruning and done

This is the list of things I want to do, append etc after submitting the thesis.
It's important to do to achieve the knowledge goal of the project.

Chapter 1
Taylor's theroems for SVC, for MVC, practice, derivation etc
Sufficient condition for differentiability

Chapter 2
Oooh the set of functions for which derivative exists at a point
Taylor series generation and approximation
Approximation of functions by polynomials

Chapter 3
Uniqueness and existence proofs for Lebesgue measure

Chapter 4
Different dimensions : similarity, box etc
Check out and do examples
